Macroeconomic Data Analysis of South Africa

Summary:
This project analyses key macroeconomic indicators in South Africa, including inflation, real interest rates, and GDP growth, over time. 
The aim is to understand trends, relationships between these indicators, and the impact of major economic events such as the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data Source:
Data was obtained from the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/), including:
- Inflation (Consumer Price Index, annual %)
- Real interest rates (annual %)
- GDP growth (annual %)

Tools Used:
- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- Plotly  
- Matplotlib  

Key Findings:
- Inflation and real interest rates move closely together, reflecting the role of monetary policy in stabilizing prices.  
- Higher interest rates are associated with slower GDP growth due to increased borrowing costs.  
- Major events like the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic are clearly reflected in the data trends.  
- The interactive plots provide insights into economic dynamics and the interplay of these macroeconomic indicators.
